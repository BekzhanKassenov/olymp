pbrain is a procedural dialect of brainfuck programming language
which, well, supports procedures. commands ( and ) mark start an
d end of new procedure, indexed by contents of current cell, and
: calls procedure indexed by contents of current cell. created b
y paul m. parks in 2004 and implemented "between the hours of 9:
45 PM and 6:15 AM, in a single session", it is supported by seve
ral more interpreters and ides. the dialect is criticised for di
sallowing the reader to figure out which procedure is being call
ed from reading the code. if this is important (as if it is ever
important with esoteric languages!), one can use toadskin, yet a
nother brainfuck variation which allows named procedures. enjoy!
